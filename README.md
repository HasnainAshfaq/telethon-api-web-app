Tele PostMan - a complete web app based on Telethon API to send messages on Telegram

# What Tele PostMan does?
It lets you add unlimited Telegram users and lets you select the users from the app and then lets you send messages.

This is a small webapp built on top of Python (Flask). Telethon is used to connect with Telegram. Sqlite3 is being used to store the data of users.

You can send messages to Telegram Users, Channels and Groups too. 

# How does it work?
Add a user, verify the user and then send messages. The user won't have to get verified second time.

It is a name for the app, I couldn't be bothered to come up with better one.
